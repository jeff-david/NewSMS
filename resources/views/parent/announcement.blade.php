                                                    The celebration of the National Youth Day kicks off today at 2:00 p.m. and the procession from the City Sports Center to the Basilica del Sto. Niño has been scheduled at 6:00 p.m. However, the roads for the procession route will be closed earlier. Traffic congestion is expected because of the said activity.

                                                    In this vein, work and classes will be until 3:00 this afternoon only due to the closure of some roads.
                                                    Work and classes will resume tomorrow, April 25, 2019, except for the classes at the Lower Basic Education that have assigned non-contact activities to the students for the whole week.
